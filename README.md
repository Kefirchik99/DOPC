## 5. Outputs

The results are displayed as:

- **Cart Value**: The value in EUR.
- **Small Order Surcharge**: Additional charge for small orders (if applicable).
- **Delivery Fee**: Calculated based on distance.

## 6. API Integration

### Endpoints Used:

- **Static Data**:
  ```bash
  https://consumer-api.development.dev.woltapi.com/home-assignment-api/v1/venues/<VENUE_SLUG>/static
  ```
- **Dynamic Data**:
  ```bash
  https://consumer-api.development.dev.woltapi.com/home-assignment-api/v1/venues/<VENUE_SLUG>/dynamic
  ```

Both endpoints return relevant data for pricing and validation. The app uses Axios for fetching data and handling errors.

## 7. How to Run Tests

To run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

The testing setup uses Jest and React Testing Library. Tests cover:

- Input validation.
- Pricing calculations.
- API integration.
- Component rendering and interactivity.

## 8. Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Attributes**: Inputs have labels, placeholders, and ARIA attributes for screen readers.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All inputs and buttons are accessible using keyboard navigation.
- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback for validation errors ensures usability for all users.
